OrchestrAI pipeline trigger
==========================

For each batch (one per platform/device[+extra-tags]) builds a pipeline plan —
one group per playbook, sharing the batch's hardware — and POSTs it to the
OrchestrAI pipeline job (buildWithParameters). Polls the queue item until the
build starts and records its URL so the matrix job can wait on it.

Then watches each build until it has acquired machines, and resubmits a batch
whose build timed out waiting for machines before anything ran, up to
run_settings.acquire_retries times (see .github/orchestrai/acquire_retry.py).

Environment-specific values (OrchestrAI pipeline URL/job, provisioning scripts, TheRock
URLs, Linux/Windows driver sources, run settings) come from
.github/orchestrai-config.yml. Credentials come from env
(ORCHESTRAI_PIPELINE_USER / ORCHESTRAI_PIPELINE_TOKEN).

Usage:
    orchestrai_trigger.py [--config .github/orchestrai-config.yml] [--dry-run]

Inputs (env):
    BATCHES_JSON            batches from orchestrai_matrix.py
    GIT_REF                 github.ref (recorded as PLAYBOOK_REF)
    MACHINES_PER_HW_GROUP   override; falls back to config default
    ORCHESTRAI_PIPELINE_USER, ORCHESTRAI_PIPELINE_TOKEN

Outputs:
    build_urls={...}  -> $GITHUB_OUTPUT   (batch_id -> OrchestrAI pipeline build URL)
    --dry-run prints each plan/builds payload and POSTs nothing.

Fails fast (exit 1) on a misconfigured run rather than acquiring scarce
hardware that can't provision: missing config keys, missing creds, or a batch
whose required provisioning value (TheRock URL or Linux/Windows driver source)
is unset.
